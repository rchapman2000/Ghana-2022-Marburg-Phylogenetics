  h to print Help 
  y to accept or type a letter to change an option (x = Exit) 
Tree 1 
Minimum branch length of time scaled tree (settable via option -u and -U): 0.0122585, rounded to 0.0109589 (4/365) using factor 365 (settable via option -R)
*WARNINGS:
- There are some nodes in the input date file that are not present in the input tree.
- 15.0943% internal branches were collapsed.
*RESULTS:
- Dating results:
 rate 0.000153777, tMRCA 1716-12-06, objective function 0.294845
